# BattleShip
## BattleShip game written in OOP C++ language.

Hello everyone, I would like to share with you my BattleShip application which I created in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.

The main idea behind creating this game was to use Object Oriented Programing.

This game has different file classes to handle various processes:
  #Player.cpp & Player.h to get correct input and place ships on the board.
  #Computer.cpp & Computer.h to place ships on the CPU board randomly.
  #Shooting.cpp & Shooting.h to initialize shooing. Also, smart shooting of CPU is here.
  
One of the hardest task was to create "Smart CPU". It means then CPU hits your ship, next turn it has to shoot next to sunken ship.

### I am waiting for recommendations to improve the code. I know it is messy, so I am looking forward to improve it!
